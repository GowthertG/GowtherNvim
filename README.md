# GowtherNvim Configuration

Welcome to my Neovim configuration repository! This setup is based on LunarVim, a powerful and highly extensible Neovim configuration framework. LunarVim provides a solid foundation that allows me to customize and enhance my editing experience.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have LunarVim installed on your system. You can follow the installation instructions provided in the LunarVim repository: [LunarVim Installation](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim#installation)

## Configuration Details

My Neovim configuration is an extension of LunarVim. All my additional configurations are now stored in a `config.lua` file written in Lua, please add this file to ~/.config/lvim/

Feel free to explore the `config.lua` file to see how I've customized various aspects of Neovim, including plugins, colorschemes, key mappings, and more.

## Reminder and Requirements

- **Reminder:** This configuration is built upon LunarVim. If you're not familiar with LunarVim, I recommend going through their documentation to understand the underlying concepts and features.
- **Requirement:** Before using my customized Neovim configuration, please ensure that you have LunarVim installed on your system. It serves as the foundation for these customizations.

## Contributions

If you find anything interesting in my configuration or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. The Neovim community thrives on sharing knowledge and learning from one another.
